## 🧠 How It Works

1. The app uses **JavaScript** to handle user input, manage selected currencies, and communicate with external APIs.  
2. Currency data and country flags are dynamically fetched using the **CurrencyAPI** and **FlagsAPI**, ensuring all results stay accurate and current.  
3. Conversion logic automatically recalculates results whenever the user types a new value or changes a selected currency.  
4. The app was developed using **Vite**, a lightning-fast frontend build tool for modern web apps.  
5. Deployment is handled via **Vercel**, ensuring fast global CDN performance and automatic updates on each Git push.
